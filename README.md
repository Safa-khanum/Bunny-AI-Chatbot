# 🐰 Bunny AI Chatbot

A customizable and aesthetically designed chatbot built using Streamlit, Google Gemini API, and ngrok to enable both local and global access. The application provides an interactive chat interface powered by Gemini’s language model while maintaining a smooth and responsive frontend built with Streamlit. It runs seamlessly on localhost, within the same network, or publicly through ngrok, making it easy to share and test across different devices.

This project began at the GDG BMSIT&M chatbot workshop, where foundational skills like API integration and Streamlit basics were learned. I later expanded with custom UI, floating animations, avatars, and chat management features to create a polished and aesthetic chatbot experience.
